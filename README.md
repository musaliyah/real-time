  ## Description: 
  Real Time is a social networking application. This repository builds an API for Real Time using Mongo DB. In Real Time users are able to interact through sharing their thoughts and reactions with their friends. While creating this application I faced several challenges in creating succeesful delete routes and working reaction requests. Throught working through this challenge assignment, I learned how to utilize a new database. 

  ## Installation: 
  To install this project, users must clone this repository and run several npm installs. Namely, npm i express, npm i mongoose and npm i moment. Then to start the server users must also type npm start into their terminals.

  ## Usage: 
  New data can be added through using Insomnia and the suggested routes. Refer to the videos below to watch a navigation of insomnia.
